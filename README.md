# Alyok Autotag

Obsidian community plugin for **automatic tagging of notes** based on their folders, creation date, and user rules.  
Helps keep your vault tidy without manually managing tags.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Folder ‚Üí Tags rules**  
  Define rules in settings: notes inside a specific folder automatically get the corresponding tags.

- **`#new` tag for fresh notes**  
  New notes created outside of any rule folder can automatically receive a `#new` tag.

- **Automatic retag on move/rename**  
  If a note is moved to another folder, its tags are updated according to the rules.  
  Optionally, the `#new` tag is removed after the first move.

- **Creation timestamp tag**  
  Each note can automatically receive a tag with its creation date/time, e.g.:  
```

\#2025-08-31-14-35

````

- **Optional title stamping**  
If enabled in settings, new notes are named by default with their creation timestamp (e.g. `2025-08-31-14-35.md`).  
You can still append extra text manually.

- **Safe tag block**  
Tags are written into the note as a block at the bottom:  
```markdown
<!-- Alyok Autotag -->
#tag1
#tag2
````

The plugin ensures the block is never inserted inside code blocks (e.g. DataviewJS).

* **Configurable block marker**
  Default is `<!-- Alyok Autotag -->`, but you can customize it.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

* **Mode**
  Currently only `block` mode is supported (tags are written at the bottom of the note).

* **Add #new on create**
  Automatically tag new notes with `#new`.

* **Remove #new on rename**
  Remove the `#new` tag after a note is moved/renamed.

* **Stamp date-time to title on create**
  When enabled, new notes are created with their timestamp as filename.

* **Block marker**
  Change the marker string for the auto-tag block.

* **Rules (folder ‚Üí tags)**
  Add rules mapping folders to tags.
  The UI provides a **dropdown of existing folders** (with fuzzy search) to avoid typos.
